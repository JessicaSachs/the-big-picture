# Vitest and The Big Picture

Today we'll be working in a hybrid of this repository and _Miro_. The Miro board link is [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKJWBNAo=/) and I'll give you the password once we've gotten started.

## Get Started

1. Clone this repository and make sure you can run it.
2. `git clone git@github.com/jessicasachs/the-big-picture`
3. `pnpm install` (or npm, but it might be a bit slower)
4. `pnpm dev`

When you're ready, open Miro and we'll get started shortly.

## Environment Setup

You can change out things like which package manager you use, if you'd like. There may be issues in doing so, but likely not. This workshop was developed using Node 20 and run with PNPM 9.
